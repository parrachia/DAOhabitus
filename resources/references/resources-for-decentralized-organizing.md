# Resources for decentralized organizing

🐒 Hi I’m [Richard D. Bartlett](http://richdecibels.com/)! I’m writing [a book about decentralised organising](https://leanpub.com/patterns-for-decentralised-organising/), finding lessons across diverse contexts, from social movements to formal workplaces.

I recently [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1075525912475590656) and on [a mailing list](http://fairsay.com/networks/ecampaigning-forum) for examples of decentralised organisations that have a public, transparent, well-documented handbook that explains how they work \(e.g. decision making, roles, communications tools, etc\). The response was overwhelming so I’ve digested it into this page.

**If you have more to add,** please [edit this page](https://hackmd.io/s/Skh_dXNbE/edit?both), contribute [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1078822810720468992), or email [rich@thehum.org](mailto:rich@thehum.org) ![:heart\_eyes:](https://hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/heart_eyes.png)

### Why <a id="Why"></a>

I think the best structure for any organising effort must be custom-fit to its local context. I don’t believe in “one size fits all” solutions, but we don’t need to start from a blank slate either. [My book](https://leanpub.com/patterns-for-decentralised-organising/)is a collection of “patterns”, experiences that are common in all collaborative groups. Each pattern names a common _dysfunction_ \(e.g. unfair distribution of care labour\), and a _response_ \(e.g. account for care work the same way you treat other work\).

My approach to organisational development:

1. 🏠 understand the **local context** for this org: history, relationships, intentions, strengths, obstacles, etc.
2. 🌏 zoom out to a **global view** to find an appropriate frame of reference \(e.g. \#agile, \#teal, \#sociocracy, \#coops, \#designthinking, \#artofhosting\)
3. 🔎 zoom in to an _**adjacent**_ **local context** \(i.e. another organisation that shares something in common with this one\)
4. 🏡 **return home** with lessons to inform the next experiment we’ll try

So the “handbooks” listed here are examples of _local_ context \(with much gratitude to the authors who make their experience transparent for others to learn from\). The “toolkits and books” are _global_ lessons extracted from local experience.
