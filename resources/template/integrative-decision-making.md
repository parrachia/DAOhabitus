# Integrative Decision Making

[From Max:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QyCfUZVveBDw2Mib8jFKiM-mBZHNbNAbaBve5EylGY/edit?usp=sharing)

We need to agree on processes of decision making internally to setup/change collective expectations. I propose [Integrative Decision Making](https://medium.com/org-hacking/holacracys-integrative-decision-making-process-f750d4b82abc) \(IDM\) process.

IDM is developed for self-organized environment but optimized for speed & efficiency. The core principle is consent \(nobody objects\), instead of consensus \(all support\) for setting expectations.

Expectations can take forms of a\) policy – rule that limits freedom in specific situations \(don’t litter\) b\) roles accountabilities – to do prescriptions for a person holding this roles \(secretary does meeting minutes\) and c\) domains – objects under control of some role \(domain “funds” for directorship, domain “website” for communications etc\).

Anybody can raise an expectations setup/change on the group meetings, with the IDM routine processed by the facilitator by the next steps:

1. **Present Proposal** — proposer describes the problem that she saw and the solution she proposes
2. **Clarifying Questions** — anyone can ask clarifying questions. Proposer can answer. No reactions or dialog allowed.
3. **Reaction Round** — each person can react to the proposal as they see fit. No discussion or responses.
4. **Amend & Clarify** — proposer can optionally clarify the intent or amend the proposal based on reactions. No discussion allowed.
5. **Objection Round** — The Facilitator asks each person in turn: ”Do you see any reasons why adopting this proposal would cause harm or move us backwards?” \(an “Objection”\). Objections are stated, tested, and captured without discussion; the proposal is adopted if none surface.
6. **Integration** — The goal is to craft an amended proposal that would not cause the Objection, but that would still address the proposer’s problem. Focus on each Objection, one at a time. Once all are integrated, go through another Objection Round.

If the proposal passes secretary should move the decision to the “Roles & Policies” doc, from meeting minutes.

**Expectation not set in “Roles & Policies” doc are not valid.**
