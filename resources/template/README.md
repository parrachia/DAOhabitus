"Start by questioning the status quo and running tests to validate you’re making, regardless of whether they’ve worked somewhere else. Ensure that you’re talking to right people and running appropriate validation \([qualitative tests can provide insightful feedback](http://blog.invisionapp.com/get-better-qualitative-data-on-your-user-experience-with-microfeedback/)\), rather than allowing internal stakeholders to dictate directions based on opinion or anecdotal experience.
