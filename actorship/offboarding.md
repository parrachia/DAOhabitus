# Offboarding

{% hint style="info" %}
WORK IN PROGRESS
{% endhint %}

## Conditions

The moment a state or quality associated with being an actor of our ecosystem ceases to exist, offboarding may be considered. Albeit those states and qualities might fall in dynamic definitions, some very basic, critical points are listed in the [Actorship page](./).

### The Ritual

The actual **Offboarding Ritual** should have the same 4-steps structure of an [Onboarding](onboarding/):

1. Validation
   * Anyone can _consult_ to the [Administrative Circle](../circles/administrative.md) about offboarding
   * The Circle itself can notice a liveness/accountability lapse
2. Application 
   * Anyone can _submit_ to the Administrative Circle an offboarding petition 
3. Approval 
   * Through [internal mechanisms](../circles/administrative.md), circle operatives discuss best course of action
4. Consolidation
   * If they determine that offboarding is in order, circle lead informs offboarded party
     * The redistribution of any crucial role left vacant from this process is overseen by the circle as well 
   * If they determine offboarding is the wrong choice, they take no action
   * In either case, [they log a record](../decision-making/signaling.md) of their decision-making process

### Straightforward Offboarding Triggers

* Liveness
  * 1 month without participation on actionables 
  * 2 weeks unjustified inactivity 
* [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct/)
  * 3 breaches of any kind
  * 1 critical breach
* [Accountability](code-of-conduct/accountability.md)
  * Critical non delivery 
  * Conflict of interest
* MESH
  * Complain about too many memes
