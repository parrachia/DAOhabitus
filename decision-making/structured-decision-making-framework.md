# Structured Decision-Making Framework

![](../.gitbook/assets/decisions-complex.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Simply put, if your [assessment](risk-assessment.md) indicates a decision impacts many stakeholders, then it should follow a structured **framework:** build a proposal, validate & vote it, decide & [consolidate](signaling.md) it.  
{% endhint %}

A **Structured Decision-Making Framework** is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is _higher risk_. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made.[\*]()

Structure removes ambiguity around process and should lead to better decisions with lower overhead.

## The Framework

 The framework has three stages: **\(1\)** proposal building, **\(2\)** validation, and **\(3\)** decision.

1. **Proposal Building** is about describing what decision we’re making, who needs to make the decision, who is impacted, and when the decision needs to be made. Done in our Dev Environment \(i.e. freely\)
2. **Validation** is voting on the options. In a [Decision Arena](https://parrachia.gitbook.io/dao-habitus/~/edit/drafts/-Lb_yhztYRhD12uOf3NS/decision-making/signaling#arenas)
3. **Decision** documents the decision made, the rationale for the decision, and the plan to communicate the decision back to those impacted. _You are here-ish_, this is literally what this proposal is about.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are multiple templates, where the **IDM** below is the preferred choice, **Decentraland's framework** is also useful for when it's far away from the next call \(or not enough quorum\) or too big for Trello \(using [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/g/X5fYj0u1/daoincubator) instead\). 
{% endhint %}

### Consent based \(default\)

IDM is developed for self-organized environment but optimized for speed & efficiency. The core principle is consent \(**nobody objects**\), instead of consensus \(**all support**\) for setting expectations.

### Consensus based

Whenever IDM is not the best fit \(e.g. not enough quorum\) using a dedicated decision [arena](https://parrachia.gitbook.io/dao-habitus/~/edit/drafts/-Lb_yhztYRhD12uOf3NS/decision-making/signaling#arenas) like Loomio should do the trick

## Conclusion

Difficult decisions can be a source of stress in many organizations, but they don’t have to be. In high performing organizations, they are opportunities to make rapid progress, innovate, and win.

There are many ways to mess up decision making, and just like anything you will get better at it over time. I’ve compiled a list of failure modes below and tried to give them a memorable name:

* **Lots of chatter** A bunch of one-off conversations happen instead of getting all input providers in a room to share knowledge together \(fully connected information sharing\).
* **Lord of the flies** No clear decision maker chosen until after battle lines have been drawn.
* **Last minute addition** Realizing that someone should have been an input provider late in the process, and trying to sneak them in.
* **Conflict of interest** A biased decision maker is chosen instead of a neutral one.
* **In the weeds** A manager chooses them self as the decision maker when it could have been delegated to someone on their team.
* **Pulling rank** A manager chooses someone else as the decision maker, then overrules them at the last minute! \(you have to genuinely be ok with whatever the decision maker decides if you’re going to delegate\)
* **Yes people** Letting the most senior/privileged voices in the room sway a conversation, before hearing what others think.
* **Accidental yes** The discussion happens over email \(generating momentum of +1s\), one-off conversations, or a rushed meeting with busy people. There appears to be consensus, but the input providers haven’t given the decision due consideration.
* **Analysis paralysis** The decision is delayed past the decision date in the hopes of receiving more data. \(“Let’s split test it!” can be a form of this if taken too far.\)
* **Creativity killer** Failing to separate enumeration of options from evaluation of options.
* **Tearing off the bandaid** Letting “there are no good options!” prevent you from choosing the “least bad” option.
* **Too much process** Using the decision making process on a low-risk decision when the manager could have unilaterally, and more quickly, made it in the moment.
* **Unintentional democracy** The decision maker feels pressured to choose the option with the most votes, abdicating their responsibility to choose what they feel is really the best option.

This framework is derived from another that has helped both Coinbase and Decentraland make better decisions, faster, with more buy in. Hopefully we will find it useful as well!
